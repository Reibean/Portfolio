        <p class="text">My name is Reiley Burnitt and I am currently learning how to code in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! This entire webpage is dedicated to centralizing all of my work and progress into one document for easy navigation for myself, colleagues, and/or potential employers! I have been coding for approximately 3 weeks now and I am in love with it. I currently work in customer service and dealing with people in the way I do day in day out would drive anyone insane so I took a leap to learn a new skillset and it is the most amazing fit for me. I encourage anyone who's not happy with the way they are living to make a change in a part of it. There's a saying that goes, "If you want something you've never had, you have to do something you've never done." I think everyone can apply that to some aspect of their life in some way or another to achieve something they thought would always be a dream.</p>
